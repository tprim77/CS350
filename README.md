Coursework for SNHU CS350  Emerging Sys Arch and Tech

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

This project creates a thermostat that can be used to turn the heat on and off. The set point can be adjusted so it will turn on and off automatically depending on the temperature in the room.

**What did you do particularly well?**

I was able to take all of the lessons we learned throughout the course and apply them relatively well to work together. 

**Where could you improve?**

I could still improve on the overall understanding of a lot of the board in general. There is still a  lot of functionality to learn and I feel I have only seen a small potential of what it is capable of.

**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

This was my first time using Code Composer Studio, and it will be a valuable resource if I am developing for a TI board in the future.

**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

Learning an entirely new system in a relatively short time period will be able to transfer to other projects. Knowing that I have gone with no knowledge of embedded systems to making a functional app will be beneficial.

**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I followed best practices to make sure the code was maintainable, readable, and adaptable. This included following best naming practices and commenting to make sure it was as clear as possible to anyone reading it.
